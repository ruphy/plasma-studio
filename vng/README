Compiling
=========
To compile this project you need Qt4.4 or later, only the qt-core library is used.

To generate a makefile call the 'qmake' command in the vng directory.  Make
sure you call the one from the right Qt release.
Some linux distros ship this command names 'qmake-qt4'

After calling qmake, compile the project like you would any other.  This is
platform dependent and could be "nmake", "make" etc.

You will find the "vng" command line in the build directory, on Windows it will
be in a subdirectory like debug\vng.exe or release\vng.exe.

Thats all!


Pushing & Committing
====================

if you make any changes to the sourcecode, it would be great if you can share that with us.
The hosting site http://repo.or.cz/w/vng.git allows you to share your recorded changes
with minimal fuss with us.
After recording your changes all you need to do is to call
  git push git+ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/vng.git +master:mob
this will push your changes so the rest of the world can see them.  Be sure to write
easy to understand comments for your commits!


Have fun.
